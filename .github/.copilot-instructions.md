# Copilot Instructions

## Unit Testing
- Use Python's built-in `unittest` framework for all unit tests.
- Import `TestCase` from `unittest` and structure test classes to inherit from `TestCase`.
- Place all test files in the `tests` directory, following the naming convention `test_*.py`.
- Write clear and concise test methods that start with `test_`.

## Linting and Style
- Ensure all code passes `flake8` linting before submission.
- Adhere to the `.flake8` configuration in the project root for line length, ignored rules, and docstring conventions.
- Use Google-style docstrings for all public classes and methods.

## Architecture Reference
- Refer to `docs/architecture.md` for the overall system architecture, workflows, and data organization.
- Follow the architectural guidelines and workflows described in `architecture.md` when designing or updating features.

## General Guidelines
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Follow existing project structure and conventions.
- Add or update unit tests for any new features or bug fixes.
