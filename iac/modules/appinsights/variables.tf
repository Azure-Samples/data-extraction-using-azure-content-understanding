This variable controls whether or not telemetry is enabled for the module.
For more information see <https://aka.ms/avm/telemetryinfo>.
If it is set to false, then no telemetry will be collected.
As explained in the [AVM documentation](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/help-support/telemetry/),
Microsoft relies on telemetry to identify the deployments of the AVM Modules.
Deployments are identified through a specific GUID (Globally Unique ID), indicating that the code originated from AVM.
The data is collected and governed by Microsoftâ€™s privacy policies, found in the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).
Telemetry collected does not provide Microsoft with insights into the resources deployed,
their configuration or any customer data stored in or processed by Azure resources deployed by using code from AVM.
Microsoft does not track the usage/consumption of individual resources using telemetry.
Telemetry collection is strictly optional, and it can easily be opted out of by following
[these procedures](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/help-support/telemetry/#opting-out).
