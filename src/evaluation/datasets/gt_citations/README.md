# Citation Dataset

This repo contains the data needed for a citations evaluation set.
It is currently a work in progress as the citation evaluator is not implemented yet.
The citations dataset may be depended on the lesa_config used, which is why it included in the repo.
Questions that do not require any citations are low hanging fruit to add to the dataset over time.
The final schema of the citation dataset is subject to change.
